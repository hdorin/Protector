Project I did as an attempt to simulate file encryption based on a secret symmetric key. When I started to study real-world cryptograpy at the faculty, I realised that encrypting files is not as easy as I thought. Anyway, through this project I learned about the need to encrypt and decrypt, binary file encoding in C++, "Temp" folder and ways to add randomness to cryptotext.
